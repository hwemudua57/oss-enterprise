# Releasing Open Source

You want to release something as open source? Awesome! It's up to you to get it ready, but don't worry, you are never alone. Open a [new issue](issues/new?template=new-release.md) to get started. [Consider these questions as you start to open source the project.](docs/key-questions-for-choosing-projects.md)

## What should be open source?

It's easier to answer this question in terms of what should **not** be open sourced:

1. Don't open source anything that represents core business value.  If it makes us lots of money by being closed source, don't open source it.
2. Don't open source anything that is specific to internal processes. If it won't be useful to anyone that doesn't work here, don't open source it.
3. Don't open source anything you can't commit to maintaining long-term. Some projects are inherently difficult to maintain. If you don't want to spend time accepting contributions and working with the open source community, don't open source it.

## Open Source Maintainer Expectations

Before you open source your project, consider the effort required to maintain it. Being an great open source maintainer requires more effort than managing a closed source project. Read our [Maintainer Guide](docs/maintainers-guide.md) to understand what will be expected of you.
